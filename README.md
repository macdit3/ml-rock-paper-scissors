# The Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
![alt text](images/Rock-paper-scissors_rules.png)

This application enables users to engage in the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game against a computer opponent. Upon initialization, the program displays a welcome message and provides comprehensive instructions for users to make their selection. The application then evaluates whether the user has won, tied, or lost against the computer's choice. The program continues to prompt the user for subsequent selections until they opt to quit, thereby terminating the application. The implementation primarily utilizes two fundamental Python programming concepts: loops for iterative processes and function definition and invocation.
